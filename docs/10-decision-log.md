## 2026-08-05 — Navigation phase 1 built: Upgrades, cosmetic decor, boost tray

**Decision.** Built phase 1 of [15-navigation-and-ia.md](15-navigation-and-ia.md). Badges renamed
to Upgrades (no content change — it already held badges and the eight harvesters). Decor's stat
role was deleted outright rather than merged into Upgrades; the items themselves became cosmetic
and moved to a new Shop tab. Boosters lost their dock tab and sheet panel entirely; they now surface
as chips in the status rail — a countdown while active, a tap-to-buy-and-activate chip while
affordable and idle, nothing otherwise. Dock is now `Upgrades · Apiary · Craft · Shop`. Existing
decor owners are refunded at purchase price on first load, via a version-gated migration (save
schema 2 → 3).

**Why decor was deleted rather than merged.** The doc's "merge Badges and Decor into one Upgrades
surface" language describes fixing the duplication, not literally combining both cards into one
list. Badges already covered every stat decor touched; decor's only remaining job is to be an
honest cosmetic sink.

**Why boosts kept ticket-purchase instead of becoming reward-only immediately.** The doc's full
vision sources boosts from order rewards, rewarded video and drops — none of which exist yet (no
order system, no ad mediation, no drop mechanic). Cutting the only working acquisition path with
nothing to replace it would have made every booster dead content and stranded the ticket currency,
which exists almost entirely to buy them. Keeping ticket-purchase, just relocated off the dock and
into a tap-to-activate tray, satisfies the navigational goal (off the dock, contextual, one tap)
without inventing a new drop economy inside what was scoped as a small, safe, self-contained
change. Retiring tickets and wiring up real reward sources is its own balance project, deliberately
deferred — flagged to the designer before building, who confirmed this reading.

**Why the refund keeps the item rather than deleting it.** The alternative — stripping decor
entirely from a save — would have been a bigger surprise for the same generosity budget. Keeping it
as a cosmetic record and adding the refund on top costs nothing extra and reads as "this got better
for you," not "this got taken away."

**Why schema version was bumped for the first time.** `version` had been set unconditionally since
its introduction, reserved for exactly this kind of change. Decor's meaning changed (stat-carrying
→ cosmetic), which is what the save-data doc's guidance calls for a version bump over. See the
worked example in [07-save-data.md](07-save-data.md).

## 2026-08-05 — Navigation: places on the map, systems in the dock

**Decision.** The dock holds `World · Orders · Shop · Almanac · Events`. Regions are locations on
the map, never tabs. Upgrades become contextual to the object they upgrade. Decor becomes purely
cosmetic. Boosts become power-ups sourced from rewards rather than a shop. Full specification and
build order in [15-navigation-and-ia.md](15-navigation-and-ia.md).

**What prompted it.** The dock is labeled `aria-label="Shops"`, which is an accurate description of
the problem: every tab was a checkout, so no tab had a distinct job. Badges and Decor turned out to
be the same system twice — four decor items and four badges modifying the same four stats, differing
only in the currency paid.

**Why regions must not be tabs.** The locked design is a contiguous map that grows outward. Tabs and
a map are competing navigation models: if regions stay tabs the map becomes decoration, the visible
sprawl that was supposed to be the reward stops being load-bearing, and every new region costs a
dock slot out of five. The Apiary and Craft tabs shipped as an explicit prototype shortcut.

**Why upgrades become contextual.** A flat list of eight nearly identical plot harvesters is a
symptom of a global menu doing per-object work. Attaching upgrades to the object is the
Township/Hay Day pattern and is the only reason the dock can stay at five slots as regions multiply.
Phased last because a flat list is genuinely fine while there is one region.

**Why decor loses its stats rather than badges being deleted.** Cosmetics are a clean gem sink and
an expression layer that supports the monetization plan; a second stat menu supports nothing.
Existing owners get refunded at purchase price, because exact conversion into badge levels is not
possible — Crystal Fountain's multiplicative `tapYield` has no equivalent in Power Punch's flat +1.

**Why boosts leave the dock.** They are power-ups, and players do not shop for power-ups — in Coin
Master they fall out of the slot machine. Moving them to a contextual tray also places the
rewarded-video prompt where a player actually wants a boost, which is worth more than a menu entry.
This is also the natural moment to retire tickets, since tickets exist almost entirely to buy
boosts.

**Considered and rejected: a "Manage" mega-tab** holding upgrades, decor and boosts behind
sub-tabs. Least disruptive to the current code, but it renames the junk drawer instead of emptying
it. Also rejected: making the order board the home screen, which demotes the garden — in a cozy
game the pleasure is the place, not the checklist.

## 2026-08-05 — Garden ↔ Apiary ↔ Apothecary prototyped

**Built** the smallest closed version of the resource loop in the web build, as two dock tabs.
Mechanics in [03-systems.md](03-systems.md), tests in `tools/sim-test.js`.

**Why a sheet tab rather than hives beside the garden.** The prototype exists to answer one
question — is the loop fun — and a camera, a world map and region art answer none of it. The tab
reuses the existing sheet architecture and is throwaway if the loop fails.

**Why honey variety is fixed when the jar is produced.** Sampling at collection time is simpler, and
exploitable: leave the garden empty, plant one Eternal Crown, collect five jars of the most
valuable honey. Fixing variety at production forces the bloom to have actually stood in the garden
while the bees worked. Offline accrual still works because production is derived from elapsed time.

**Why flowers are a byproduct rather than replacing credits.** Harvest pays credits *and* banks the
bloom. Making crafting compete with the existing payout would have meant rebalancing the entire
nineteen-seed economy to test one hypothesis. As a byproduct, crafting is additive and the existing
balance is untouched.

**Why crafted goods sell for credits.** A placeholder for the Market. The invariant that orders must
pay more than selling still holds — these prices are the floor orders have to beat.

**Why storage caps were left out**, despite being a locked design decision. They add friction that
would confound the only question the prototype asks. They go in when the Market does.

**Deliberately untuned.** Every value is provisional. `tools/sim-test.js` asserts the *invariants*
that must survive tuning — crafted goods beat their ingredients by at least 1.35×, and every recipe
spans two regions — rather than the numbers themselves.

## 2026-08-05 — Resource graph locked; merge replaces match-3; world stays botanical

**Decisions.** Five regions: Garden, Apiary, Potting Shed, Apothecary, Market. The one new mechanic
is **merge**, not match-3. Mining and chickens are cut. Tickets retired, water never introduced.
Land unlocks via reputation. Full specification in
[12-meta-layer-design.md](12-meta-layer-design.md), with the Market in
[13-order-system.md](13-order-system.md) and resources in [14-economy-model.md](14-economy-model.md).

**Why merge over match-3.** Reversed from the previous entry. Content efficiency is decisive at two
people: match-3 players burn roughly fifty hand-designed levels a week, and that treadmill has
killed more small teams than anything else. A merge item tree entertains for months. Merge is also
cheaper to build (no cascade resolution, blocker taxonomy, booster interactions or level editor),
is the strongest-performing casual mechanic of the current era, and its slower pace suits a cozy
game. Decisively, seed-breeding *is* merging — mechanic and fiction are the same thing, so there's
no metaphor to teach.

**Why bees instead of chickens, and no mine.** Tonal coherence is this game's cheapest competitive
advantage. A cozy magical garden with a talking flower is a specific, defensible identity; grey ore
and a chicken coop pull it toward generic farm-sim, where it competes with Hay Day and loses. Bees
deliver the same production fantasy on-brand — and honey type following current blooms creates a
*harder* dependency than a resource sink, because the garden's contents matter, not just its
throughput.

**Why a crafting tier was added.** Previously under-specified. A graph where regions produce raws
and the Market consumes them still leaves regions parallel — players farm whichever raw pays best.
An Apothecary that combines flowers and honey into perfume, with the Market wanting *perfume*, makes
the dependency structural rather than a matter of pricing.

**Why reputation gates land, not coins.** Idle economies inflate coins unpredictably; reputation
only moves when a player engages the whole graph, making it a controlled progression gate.

**Why tickets are retired and water was never added.** Casual players fall off past four or five
tracked quantities. Tickets existed only as an inheritance from the previous build. Water is
friction without fun — watering stays a tap interaction, which `hasten()` already implements.

**Deliberately not tuned.** The numbers in [14-economy-model.md](14-economy-model.md) are
placeholders. Tuning waits until the Garden ↔ Apiary loop has been played, because values chosen
before the loop is felt are fiction with decimal places.

## 2026-08-05 — Direction set: modest revenue, multi-region meta-layer, one new mechanic

> **Partly superseded** by the entry above: the new mechanic is now merge in the Potting Shed, not
> match-3 in a mine, and the region themes changed. Everything else here still stands.

**Decisions.** Target is modest revenue (a few thousand a month), not a venture-scale hit. Next
milestone is a multi-region world built as one contiguous expanding map. Regions feed a single
interlocking economy driven by a Township-style order system. Exactly **one** genuinely new
mechanic — match-3 in the mine — with other regions shipping as timer production until the
structure proves it retains. An engineer ports to Unity, starting with the platform shell rather
than the garden.

**Why modest revenue.** Township-tier games are user-acquisition businesses with games attached;
success there is roughly 20% game quality and 80% economy tuning, liveops and CPI-versus-LTV
arithmetic, funded by large marketing spend. A two-person team without a UA budget can't compete
on that axis, but a well-made niche idle game with player-friendly monetization and web-portal
distribution is genuinely achievable.

**Why one contiguous map over a hub with rooms.** Visible sprawl is itself the reward and the store
screenshot; no context switching means short sessions still touch several systems; one scene is far
cheaper than N region screens.

**Why the order system.** Nothing else in the design consumes multiple resources at once, so without
it players optimise the single best region and interdependence is never felt. It's also the
cheapest infinitely-extensible content lever available and becomes the liveops surface later.

**Why only one new mechanic.** Four minigames is four games' worth of tuning, art, tutorial and bug
surface for two people. Players need distinct rewards and visuals, not distinct mechanics.

**Why data-driven numbers are non-negotiable.** If changing a grow time needs an engineer and a
build, tuning stops — and an untuned economy is the most common cause of death in this genre.

Full specification in [12-meta-layer-design.md](12-meta-layer-design.md).

## 2026-08-05 — Documentation set created

**Decision.** Wrote this `docs/` folder as the onboarding surface for future work, on the
assumption that most of it will be done by agents starting with no context.

**Why.** The game had reached a size where its behaviour was only discoverable by reading roughly
3,700 lines of source. Several values (rarity weights, upgrade scaling, the growth floor) are load
bearing and easy to break without knowing they matter.

**Notes.** Every number quoted was extracted from the code, and the derived economy tables were
computed by evaluating `data.js` rather than by hand — an earlier hand-calculation of the plot 8
harvester cost was wrong by half. Original *Idle Garden Reborn* design documents were moved to
`docs/legacy/` so they can't be mistaken for current truth.

---

## 2026-08-02 — Repository made public to enable GitHub Pages

**Decision.** Made `jonishua/ghostgarden` public and enabled Pages from `main` at the root.

**Why.** The owner wanted a link to send friends. GitHub Pages doesn't serve private repositories
on the free plan, so the alternatives were paying, using a third-party host, or going public. The
repository was scanned for secrets and personal data first and contained none.

**Consequence.** The repository root is now a live public site and pushing to `main` deploys. There
is no staging environment.

---

## 2026-08-02 — Game moved into the repository root

**Decision.** Moved the game from `VIBE Games/Garden/wonder/` to the repository root, with the
previous build archived in `legacy/`.

**Why.** The git repository and the game were in unrelated folders, so there was nothing to push.
Putting the game at the root also lets Pages serve it with no configuration.

**Excluded.** `Prototype/` — 3.4 GB across 90,392 files of Next.js build output — was left on disk
and added to `.gitignore`. GitHub would have rejected it.

---

## 2026-08-01 — Rebuilt as a new directory rather than editing in place

**Decision.** Built Garden Wonder as a fresh set of files instead of refactoring *Idle Garden
Reborn*, keeping the original playable.

**Why.** The visual and structural changes touched essentially every line. A rewrite alongside the
original meant the old build stayed available for comparison, and the economy could be ported
deliberately rather than accidentally mutated.

---

## 2026-08-01 — Economy ported unchanged

**Decision.** Carried every economic value across untouched: seed costs, yields, grow times, rarity
weights, upgrade scaling, decor and booster values.

**Why.** Two reasons. Migrated saves had to behave identically or players would feel robbed. And
keeping balance frozen meant any complaint about the rebuild was unambiguously about presentation.

**Consequence.** Several quirks came along: the Orchid throughput dip, endgame seeds having lower
gem chances than a Daisy, and the combo having no payout effect. All inherited, all documented in
[11-known-issues.md](11-known-issues.md), none fixed. Fixing them is a balance project and should be
treated as one.

---

## 2026-08-01 — Split into seven modules

**Decision.** Replaced the single 1,100-line `main.js` with seven files by responsibility.

**Why.** The original mixed simulation, rendering and input in one scope, so changing a payout
formula meant reading DOM code. The split makes `game.js` independently testable in principle and
gives the art and audio systems clear boundaries.

**Trade-off.** `ui.js` is still around 1,000 lines and remains the file most in need of further
splitting.

---

## 2026-08-01 — All art generated, no asset files

**Decision.** Every visual is inline SVG or CSS. No images at all.

**Why.** Nineteen seeds needing distinct art at multiple sizes would have been the bulk of the work
as hand-drawn assets. Generating from a small data block per seed made a nineteenth flower about
eight lines. It also keeps the whole game at 476 KB, diffable, and recolourable.

**Cost.** Small-size readability had to be engineered rather than eyeballed — the slim-petal
switch above 10 petals, per-shape ring scale tuning, and omitting the core on four silhouettes all
exist because early versions turned to mush in shop cards.

---

## 2026-08-01 — All audio synthesized

**Decision.** Web Audio synthesis, no audio files, everything pitched to a C major pentatonic scale.

**Why.** Consistent with the no-assets rule, and the pentatonic constraint means any layered
combination is automatically consonant. It also enables the tap pitch climbing with the combo,
which would need dozens of samples otherwise.

---

## 2026-08-01 — Shops as a draggable bottom sheet

**Decision.** All six panels live in one bottom sheet with a drag-to-dismiss grip, rather than
inline panels or a separate screen.

**Why.** The garden had to own the screen. A sheet keeps it visible behind a scrim, matches the
platform gesture vocabulary players already know, and gives one consistent place for all content.

---

## 2026-08-01 — Save migration hardened against pristine shadowing

**Decision.** Added `isPristine()`, which discards a modern save that was written but never played
if a meaningful legacy save exists.

**Why.** Found in testing. Merely opening the new build writes a `gw-save`. Without the check, a
player who launched it once and closed it would have their real *Idle Garden Reborn* progress
shadowed permanently by an empty save.

---

## 2026-08-01 — Day cycle always starts at midday

**Decision.** `DAY_START = 0.46`, derived from page load rather than wall-clock time.

**Why.** The cycle originally began at its zero point, which is midnight, so a first launch showed
a dark screen. Starting at bright midday guarantees a good first impression, and deriving from load
time rather than the real hour means a player at 3 a.m. still gets a sunny garden.

---

## 2026-08-01 — Grid rows pinned explicitly

**Decision.** Explicit `grid-row` on `hud`, `rail`, `stage` and `dock`, with `minmax(0, 1fr)` tracks.

**Why.** A real bug. The rail hides on short screens; with implicit placement the remaining rows
shifted up and the dock stretched into the free track, producing buttons that consumed a third of
the screen.

---

## 2026-08-01 — Rare harvests get no toast

**Decision.** Toasts only for Epic and Legendary. Rare gets stars and floating text. Cap of two
toasts on screen.

**Why.** Rare is a 20% roll. With automation running, toasts became a constant stream and stopped
meaning anything. Reserving them for the top two tiers restored their signal value.

---

## 2026-08-01 — Talking flower speech throttled

**Decision.** 3.2 s minimum gap, 6% chance on taps, 12% on harvests, suppressed while a coach mark
is visible; milestones always speak.

**Why.** Speaking on every interaction turned a charming character into an irritant fast, and
bubbles collided with coach marks during onboarding.
